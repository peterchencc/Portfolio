## Background
Carousell is a consumer-to-consumer marketplace that has enabled more than 70 million transactions across 7 countries in South East Asia since 2012. When I joined Carousell, we have two agile teams, one focusing on growth and the other one focusing on core user journey. I worked on growth for a bit more than one year before we moved on to areas where we can deliver more value to our users.

## Growth team focus on helping new users to make their first sale
Growth team in Carousell focused on helping our new users to become successful sellers and list more quality items up for sale. Buyers come to the platform naturally for things they want to buy that is difficult to get elsewhere or for good deals. For us, it’s more difficult to get people onboard for selling preloved items because it’s not something they are used to. 
 
Informed by internal data and user research, we believe that people who successfully sell something within 14 days after sign-up are more likely to continue using Carousell to buy and sell. As Growth team, our job is to help people who come to Carousell with the intent to sell something to list item(s) up for sale and successfully sell it to another person.

Journey 
Download the app -> Sign up -> List an item -> Successfully sell the item

In 2017, we focus on understanding what’s stopping users to list their first item up for sale. At first, we looked into the process of listing the first item and iterate on that process to make listing an item frictionless. We see some improvement on the metrics, but it didn’t move the needle. So we started to look into how to motivate users to list instead of making the already optimised process easier.

From research we find out a few interesting things.
* Users often signed up because they heard about this platform Carousell that can help them to make extra money by selling off the underused items at home.
* However, they do not list because they’re skeptical if their item can be sold or they are not sure what to sell on Carousell.
* People who have friends successfully sold items on Carousell have more confidence that Carousell can help them sell their underused items.

After a design sprint with the team testing different ideas to help users be more confident in the platform, we decided to go with the idea of *increase people’s confidence to make a sale by showing the items that are successfully sold on Carousell*

This idea received very positive feedbacks from guerilla testing and user interviews and compared to other ideas. What made us believe the idea will work was
* The sold listings help people visualise what they can achieve on Carousell - declutter and earn extra cash. 
* We show new users how long it took to sell items on Carousell and that help them to visualise the efforts.
* Users who have no idea what they can sell want to get inspirations and reminders on things they can sell. When they see successful transactions of a old hand phone, they are reminded that they can sell their old hand phone as well, and probably get the same amount of money.

Users become more confident in Carousell and in themselves that they can sell something on Carousell.

We first tested this idea by displaying items that are recently sold on Home Screen.

When we test this with users, we found out that users with some idea what they want to sell want to find similar items on Carousell before they list to see if there is a demand for the item and how much they can earn from selling the item.

From that insight, we believe that sold listings are more important information than active listings for those users to understand demand and realistic price point. We include a prompt to nudge users to list their first items after they did some research on the items they are thinking to sell.

Results
We ran an A/B test on new users who have sell intent and users in the test group are more likely (7% to 26% across 8 markets) to list their first item up for sale, compared to users in control group.

Improve cost effectiveness of Digital marketing spend.

Learnings and future iterations
Sold listings are irrelevant for most of the buyers. When they see sold listings among the active listings, they either thought it was a bug or they found it irrelevant for them to see the listings they couldn’t get anymore.

In the later iteration, we collect users’ intent during onboarding phase and only those who have expressed sell intent would see sold listings in their experience. We over-achieved our goal to increase the conversion rate (Users who newly signed up list their first item in 7 days) by 10%.
This paved the way for Carousell to provide different experiences for users with different intent (buy or sell) to help users achieve what they want on the platform.
